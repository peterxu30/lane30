// TODO 
// P0
// - control the ball via drag instead of click
// - score should automatically update

// - clean up abstractions
// - ball trajectory should be affected by pin collisions
// - stop pin movement after a while
// - reset lane when all hit active pins velocity is 
// - The game is actually really difficult on mobile. Maybe increase ball mass, size, or speed? Maybe make pins bigger?
// - Print on screen the actual available canvas dimensions on physical iPhone because Chrome URL bar eats into available screen space
// - Add new GameState for BallReturn when ball has left the top of the screen to display "Tap to get ball back"
//     - this will be game state to display nice job message 
// - Add new GameState for pins done moving - will also automatically update score
// - Separate mouse click from game logic. RegisterClick() should have a switch for different game states

// P1
// - hook mode - where you can control the ball as it moves
// - auto reset the ball after it leaves the lane instead of requiring user to click

// DONE
