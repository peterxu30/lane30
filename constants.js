/**
 * GameStates represents the possible states of the bowling game.
 * 
 * The states are defined as follows:
 * - INITIALIZED: The initial state when game is loaded for the first time. This game is only in this state once at the beginning.
 * - NOT_RUNNING: The state the game returns to between rolls, waiting for the player to finish aiming the ball and roll.
 * - RUNNING: The ball is rolling and/or pins are moving.
 * - FRAME_DONE: The ball has rolled off screen and the pins are finished moving. Scores are calculated. The lane is reset/cleared.
 * - OVER: The tenth frame has just been completed. Game over text is displayed.
 * - RESTART: The game is reset to the beginning. All frames are cleared.
 * The state machine of the game is as follows:
 * 
 *                           --------------------------------(tap)--------------------------------
 *                           |                                                                   |
 *                           v                                                                   |
 * INITIALIZED --(tap)--> RUNNING --(automatic)--> FRAME_DONE --(automatic)--> OVER --(tap)--> RESTART
 *                           ^                         |
 *                           |                         |          
 * NOT_RUNNING -----(tap)-----                         |
 *     ^                                               |
 *     |                                               |
